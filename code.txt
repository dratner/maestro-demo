{"reason": "Implementation is complete with all required files created. The solution includes a health check endpoint handler (handlers/health.go), comprehensive tests (handlers/health_test.go), main application entry point (main.go), and proper Go module setup (go.mod). All requirements are met: GET /health endpoint returning 'OK' with text/plain content type and 200 status code. The code is well-structured, tested, and follows Go best practices."}
