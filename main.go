[assistant] Now let's create a go.mod file to properly set up the Go module:

[tool] Executed: cat > go.mod << 'EOF'
module healthcheck

go 1.21
EOF

[assistant] The implementation is now complete. Let's verify that we have created all necessary files:

1. handlers/health.go - Contains the health check endpoint handler
2. handlers/health_test.go - Contains comprehensive tests for the handler
3. main.go - Sets up the HTTP server and routes
4. go.mod - Defines the Go module

The implementation meets all requirements:
- GET /health endpoint ✓
- Returns "OK" as plain text ✓
- Sets Content-Type: text/plain header ✓
- Returns 200 OK status code ✓
- Includes comprehensive tests ✓

[tool] Executed: mark_complete
{"reason": "Implementation is complete with all required files created. The solution includes a health check endpoint handler (handlers/health.go), comprehensive tests (handlers/health_test.go), main application entry point (main.go), and proper Go module setup (go.mod). All requirements are met: GET /health endpoint returning 'OK' with text/plain content type and 200 status code. The code is well-structured, tested, and follows Go best practices."}
